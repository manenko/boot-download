`Boot`_ task to download a file from the given url.

-----
Tasks
-----

.. code-block:: clojure

   (download-file [u url         URL  str "The location of the remote file."
                   o output-path PATH str "The location used to save the file. Optional."])

Downloads a single file from the given url and adds it to the fileset
as an asset.

If the output path is not set then the task will get the file name from the url
and store the file under that name in the fileset root directory. Otherwise the
file will be saved under the given output path (the last component of the path
will be treated as a file name).

    .. caution::
       The task will fail if the :code:`output-path` is not specified and the
       url has parameters (i.e. :code:`http://example.org/file?p=foo&q=bar`).

---------
Functions
---------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
get-all-downloaded-files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: clojure

   (get-all-downloaded-files [fileset])

Gets a seq of files (as :code:`TmpFile` objects) downloaded by the
:code:`download-file` task.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
get-all-files-downloaded-from
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: clojure

   (get-all-files-downloaded-from [fileset url])

Gets a seq of files (as :code:`TmpFile` objects) downloaded from the
given url by the :code:`download-file` task.

It could happen that the :code:`fileset` has a few files downloaded
from the same url. That's why this function returns a seq instead of a
single object (or :code:`nil`). The sequence will be empty, if there
is no files downloaded from the given url.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
get-download-url
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: clojure

   (get-download-url [tmpfile])

Gets a url the given :code:`TmpFile` was downloaded from.

Console

While the task is not designed to be usable from a console you still can invoke it:

.. code-block:: text

    boot download-file --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manenko/boot-download/master/README.rst


----
TODO
----

* If the :code:`--output-path` ends with :code:`'/'` then treat the last
  component of the path as a folder (currently the task thinks it's a file name)
  and download the file to that folder under the name extracted from the url.
